Horizontal rules
----------------

You can use horizontal rules to separate paragraphs: you may use three or more `*`
******
or three or more `_` (you may insert spaces before, after or between the characters, no other characters are allowed)
__ __ __ __ 

or three (or more) `-` 

---

but you have to be careful as it is similar to the header syntax, so if you write `---` immediatly after a single line of text you get an header, either you have to leave a blank line before the `---`, or you put it after multiple lines of text
