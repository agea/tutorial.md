Headers
-------

There are two ways to define headers:

The biggest possible header
===========================

# You can also use this markup

(I prefer the first one as it's more readable when looking directly at the source code)
 
A sub heading
-------------
 
## This is the alternative format

### Then you can go smaller

#### And smaller

##### And even smaller

###### No, you can't go smaller than this

The good thing is that many tools that convert Markdown in HTML or PDF are able to generate the index of your document, or links to the headers automatically (like Github does on the [source](http://git.io/vfz98) of Markdown files)
